        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>

        <p>My name is Jeffrey Chee. I graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelors in International Studies. During my times at UCI,
        I joined Alpha Phi Omega, a community service fraternity, where I held a couple of leadership positions and did a lot 
        community services around orange county. As Corresponding Secretary, I connected my chapter with other APO fraternities 
        providing us with collaborative services and hangouts. This fraternity brought out my joy for planning events and doing 
        community services.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Once college ended, I worked for awhile in the seafood importing industry, but never really had a passion for it. I was 
        in a lost phase for awhile until I found an interest in coding. I look forward to mastering my skills in coding. </p>
